# PoOOS-LargeProject
Large Project for Processes of Object Oriented Software (Group 4)

This is ONLY finished for MERN B, MERN C has had errors and isn't working.

The default branch is "master" as that is what heroku uses. Feel free to edit as I'm not entirely sure what needs to stay.

To have this working on your computer you will need

- Files: node_modules directory and .env to be able to run this locally. For node_modules refer to MERN A, for .env refer to MERN B (sudo npm install dotenv) then add the MONGODB link. (The one I use is: MONGODB_URI=[look in Database section in Discord])

- Terminal Commands: Refer to MERN B; install/login to heroku and install git so you are able to directly update heroku yourself.
